[CleanG]
==
To run this testbed, you need to install the OpenNetVM on three servers (lets call them F2, F3, and F4).
After that, move the corresponding folder content (CleanG_FX) to the example folder of that server.
Then run each ONVM instance and each NF in that machine by using ANON executable files in each folder.
To make changes in the CleanG and apply changes to all machines, use MakeAll file in the FS2 folder.
(You may need to change the paths in this file, as paths used in that script were based on our installation.)
CleanG is on the OpenNetVM platform. If there are problem in installing ONVM and setting up the ports, please follow the instructions on  sdnfv/openNetVM repository.
